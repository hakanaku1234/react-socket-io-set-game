# Set Card Game

# Demo
https://react-socket-io-set-game.herokuapp.com/

# Background
I started this project to learn about websockets.  I already have a solid background in react and redux, so I thought I'd build off on that with new technologies.

# Milestones
- Create the SET card game in react
- Enable multiple players to play the game with socket.io
- Host the game on heroku

# Quick Start
```
npm install
npm run server
```
And in a new terminal tab:
```
npm run start
```

# Technologies Used
- react
- redux
- socket.io*
- react-transition-group*
- heroku*

Starred tech is new to me
